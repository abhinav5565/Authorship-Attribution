            "text22 is ['Shares in British commercial television (ITV) broadcaster Yorkshire-Tyne Tees slid on Tuesday despite an 80 percent rise in interim profit.\\nPre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 13.3 million pounds ($20.76 million) from 7.4 million pounds in the same period a year ago. Interim dividend was increased to 6.8 pence from 3.7 pence.\\nThe company said that the improvement had come despite a \"very disappointing\" advertising sales performance.\\nThe northern English company, based in the city of Leeds, said that a smaller than expected increase in total ITV advertising revenues had been compounded by a slight decline in its share of that income.\\nThe sales shortfall was, however, more than compensated by higher programme sales and the effects of cost controls.\\nYorkshire shares had fallen 30p to 1210 by 1440 GMT. Bid speculation has helped them to power ahead in recent months from a 1996 low of 679p.\\nThe decline was hastened after Yorkshire chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas said that he hoped British media and leisure company Granada would hold off from mounting an expected takeover bid.\\nShare analysts said that Yorkshire\\'s comments on advertising and Granada had pushed the price lower in what was already a weak London market.\\nGranada, which already operates two ITV licences, has built a 24 percent stake in Yorkshire. It had been expected to follow through with a takeover bid following a relaxation in media ownership laws.\\nBut Granada, which earlier this year acquired Britain\\'s leading Forte hotel chain for 3.9 billion pounds, has recently given the impression of going cool on the bid.\\nDuncan Lewis, head of Granada\\'s Media Division, was last month reported as saying Granada may look at other ITV targets.\\nThomas dismissed the reported comments as a \"fairly puerile attempt to get the (Yorkshire) share price down\".\\nBut he said any delay in a Granada bid would give Yorkshire time to rebuild its share of ITV advertising revenue and to make progress in its campaign for a reduction in its licence payments. These totalled 33 million pounds in the first half.\\nHe suggested that full value for Yorkshire shares in any bid could be as high as 18 pounds. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'Britain\\'s Express Newspapers, seeking to halt a long-term sales decline, announced plans on Tuesday to shed around 85 jobs as it puts its Daily and Sunday Express national titles under a single editorial team.\\nExpress Newspapers, part of the recently enlarged United News &amp; Media empire, said it would invest around 10 million pounds ($15.6 million) in an effort to improve the quality of the two ailing newspapers.\\nThe planned job cuts will cost in the region of six million pounds in redundancy charges, an Express spokesman said.\\nThe Daily Express has average sales of around 1.2 million copies, a far cry from its heyday in the 1960s when it had circulation of over four million and could boast with some justification of being \"The Voice of Britain\".\\nThe Daily Mail, its rival in the mid-market area, sells more than two million copies daily.\\nExpress Newspapers plans to offer colour supplements on Saturdays and Sundays plus a seven-day-a-week pull-out sports section. The number of pages in the titles will be increased and more of them will be in colour.\\nRichard Addis, editor of The Daily Express, will take charge of the papers seven days a week. Sunday Express editor Sue Douglas, appointed only nine months ago, has resigned.\\nThe establishment of a single editorial team is intended to make the changes easier to implement and to maximise cross readership of the two newspapers. The Sunday title also sells just over 1.2 million copies.\\nThe reorganisation confirms that United News &amp; Media plans to hang on to the titles and seek to turn them around.\\nThere had been speculation that the company might seek to divest its national titles following its merger earlier this year with MAI Plc, the television and financial services group.\\nUnited News also owns the down-market Daily Star. The Star is unaffected by the changes.\\n\"This significant new investment will improve the quality and coverage of the Express titles seven days a week and bring major benefits to our readers,\" said United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who joined the company from MAI.\\n\"Bold marketing initiatives will be launched to support our new products. This step confirms United\\'s determination to revitalise and strenghten its national newspapers,\" he added.\\nUnited News shares closed 18p lower on Tuesday in a London market depressed by U.S. interest rate fears and the hostilities in Iraq. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday.\\nPre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed.\\n\"Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,\" chief executive David Montgomery said.\\n\"The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,\" he added.\\nExceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues.\\nInterim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.\\nMarket reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p.\\nMirror Group\\'s flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain\\'s second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.\\nFinance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.\\nThe group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months.\\nIt said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror\\'s Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.\\nLive TV\\'s offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset.\\nIt said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it.\\nLive TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes. It has special local affiliates in central London and Birmingham with plans to add the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year. ($1=.6430 Pound)\\n']\n",

            "text22 is ['Shares in British commercial television (ITV) broadcaster Yorkshire-Tyne Tees slid on Tuesday despite an 80 percent rise in interim profit.\\nPre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 13.3 million pounds ($20.76 million) from 7.4 million pounds in the same period a year ago. Interim dividend was increased to 6.8 pence from 3.7 pence.\\nThe company said that the improvement had come despite a \"very disappointing\" advertising sales performance.\\nThe northern English company, based in the city of Leeds, said that a smaller than expected increase in total ITV advertising revenues had been compounded by a slight decline in its share of that income.\\nThe sales shortfall was, however, more than compensated by higher programme sales and the effects of cost controls.\\nYorkshire shares had fallen 30p to 1210 by 1440 GMT. Bid speculation has helped them to power ahead in recent months from a 1996 low of 679p.\\nThe decline was hastened after Yorkshire chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas said that he hoped British media and leisure company Granada would hold off from mounting an expected takeover bid.\\nShare analysts said that Yorkshire\\'s comments on advertising and Granada had pushed the price lower in what was already a weak London market.\\nGranada, which already operates two ITV licences, has built a 24 percent stake in Yorkshire. It had been expected to follow through with a takeover bid following a relaxation in media ownership laws.\\nBut Granada, which earlier this year acquired Britain\\'s leading Forte hotel chain for 3.9 billion pounds, has recently given the impression of going cool on the bid.\\nDuncan Lewis, head of Granada\\'s Media Division, was last month reported as saying Granada may look at other ITV targets.\\nThomas dismissed the reported comments as a \"fairly puerile attempt to get the (Yorkshire) share price down\".\\nBut he said any delay in a Granada bid would give Yorkshire time to rebuild its share of ITV advertising revenue and to make progress in its campaign for a reduction in its licence payments. These totalled 33 million pounds in the first half.\\nHe suggested that full value for Yorkshire shares in any bid could be as high as 18 pounds. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'Britain\\'s Express Newspapers, seeking to halt a long-term sales decline, announced plans on Tuesday to shed around 85 jobs as it puts its Daily and Sunday Express national titles under a single editorial team.\\nExpress Newspapers, part of the recently enlarged United News &amp; Media empire, said it would invest around 10 million pounds ($15.6 million) in an effort to improve the quality of the two ailing newspapers.\\nThe planned job cuts will cost in the region of six million pounds in redundancy charges, an Express spokesman said.\\nThe Daily Express has average sales of around 1.2 million copies, a far cry from its heyday in the 1960s when it had circulation of over four million and could boast with some justification of being \"The Voice of Britain\".\\nThe Daily Mail, its rival in the mid-market area, sells more than two million copies daily.\\nExpress Newspapers plans to offer colour supplements on Saturdays and Sundays plus a seven-day-a-week pull-out sports section. The number of pages in the titles will be increased and more of them will be in colour.\\nRichard Addis, editor of The Daily Express, will take charge of the papers seven days a week. Sunday Express editor Sue Douglas, appointed only nine months ago, has resigned.\\nThe establishment of a single editorial team is intended to make the changes easier to implement and to maximise cross readership of the two newspapers. The Sunday title also sells just over 1.2 million copies.\\nThe reorganisation confirms that United News &amp; Media plans to hang on to the titles and seek to turn them around.\\nThere had been speculation that the company might seek to divest its national titles following its merger earlier this year with MAI Plc, the television and financial services group.\\nUnited News also owns the down-market Daily Star. The Star is unaffected by the changes.\\n\"This significant new investment will improve the quality and coverage of the Express titles seven days a week and bring major benefits to our readers,\" said United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who joined the company from MAI.\\n\"Bold marketing initiatives will be launched to support our new products. This step confirms United\\'s determination to revitalise and strenghten its national newspapers,\" he added.\\nUnited News shares closed 18p lower on Tuesday in a London market depressed by U.S. interest rate fears and the hostilities in Iraq. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday.\\nPre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed.\\n\"Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,\" chief executive David Montgomery said.\\n\"The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,\" he added.\\nExceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues.\\nInterim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.\\nMarket reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p.\\nMirror Group\\'s flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain\\'s second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.\\nFinance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.\\nThe group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months.\\nIt said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror\\'s Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.\\nLive TV\\'s offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset.\\nIt said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it.\\nLive TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes. It has special local affiliates in central London and Birmingham with plans to add the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year. ($1=.6430 Pound)\\n']\n",

            "text22 is ['Shares in British commercial television (ITV) broadcaster Yorkshire-Tyne Tees slid on Tuesday despite an 80 percent rise in interim profit.\\nPre-tax profit for the six months to June 30 rose to 13.3 million pounds ($20.76 million) from 7.4 million pounds in the same period a year ago. Interim dividend was increased to 6.8 pence from 3.7 pence.\\nThe company said that the improvement had come despite a \"very disappointing\" advertising sales performance.\\nThe northern English company, based in the city of Leeds, said that a smaller than expected increase in total ITV advertising revenues had been compounded by a slight decline in its share of that income.\\nThe sales shortfall was, however, more than compensated by higher programme sales and the effects of cost controls.\\nYorkshire shares had fallen 30p to 1210 by 1440 GMT. Bid speculation has helped them to power ahead in recent months from a 1996 low of 679p.\\nThe decline was hastened after Yorkshire chairman and chief executive Ward Thomas said that he hoped British media and leisure company Granada would hold off from mounting an expected takeover bid.\\nShare analysts said that Yorkshire\\'s comments on advertising and Granada had pushed the price lower in what was already a weak London market.\\nGranada, which already operates two ITV licences, has built a 24 percent stake in Yorkshire. It had been expected to follow through with a takeover bid following a relaxation in media ownership laws.\\nBut Granada, which earlier this year acquired Britain\\'s leading Forte hotel chain for 3.9 billion pounds, has recently given the impression of going cool on the bid.\\nDuncan Lewis, head of Granada\\'s Media Division, was last month reported as saying Granada may look at other ITV targets.\\nThomas dismissed the reported comments as a \"fairly puerile attempt to get the (Yorkshire) share price down\".\\nBut he said any delay in a Granada bid would give Yorkshire time to rebuild its share of ITV advertising revenue and to make progress in its campaign for a reduction in its licence payments. These totalled 33 million pounds in the first half.\\nHe suggested that full value for Yorkshire shares in any bid could be as high as 18 pounds. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'Britain\\'s Express Newspapers, seeking to halt a long-term sales decline, announced plans on Tuesday to shed around 85 jobs as it puts its Daily and Sunday Express national titles under a single editorial team.\\nExpress Newspapers, part of the recently enlarged United News &amp; Media empire, said it would invest around 10 million pounds ($15.6 million) in an effort to improve the quality of the two ailing newspapers.\\nThe planned job cuts will cost in the region of six million pounds in redundancy charges, an Express spokesman said.\\nThe Daily Express has average sales of around 1.2 million copies, a far cry from its heyday in the 1960s when it had circulation of over four million and could boast with some justification of being \"The Voice of Britain\".\\nThe Daily Mail, its rival in the mid-market area, sells more than two million copies daily.\\nExpress Newspapers plans to offer colour supplements on Saturdays and Sundays plus a seven-day-a-week pull-out sports section. The number of pages in the titles will be increased and more of them will be in colour.\\nRichard Addis, editor of The Daily Express, will take charge of the papers seven days a week. Sunday Express editor Sue Douglas, appointed only nine months ago, has resigned.\\nThe establishment of a single editorial team is intended to make the changes easier to implement and to maximise cross readership of the two newspapers. The Sunday title also sells just over 1.2 million copies.\\nThe reorganisation confirms that United News &amp; Media plans to hang on to the titles and seek to turn them around.\\nThere had been speculation that the company might seek to divest its national titles following its merger earlier this year with MAI Plc, the television and financial services group.\\nUnited News also owns the down-market Daily Star. The Star is unaffected by the changes.\\n\"This significant new investment will improve the quality and coverage of the Express titles seven days a week and bring major benefits to our readers,\" said United News chief executive Clive Hollick, who joined the company from MAI.\\n\"Bold marketing initiatives will be launched to support our new products. This step confirms United\\'s determination to revitalise and strenghten its national newspapers,\" he added.\\nUnited News shares closed 18p lower on Tuesday in a London market depressed by U.S. interest rate fears and the hostilities in Iraq. ($1=.6406 Pound)\\n', 'British national newspaper publisher Mirror Group Plc defied a steep rise in newsprint costs to post a small profit increase on Wednesday.\\nPre-tax profit before exceptional items in the first six months of the year rose by 2.9 percent to 39 million pounds ($60.6 million). This came despite an increase of 18 million pounds in the cost of newsprint -- the material on which newspapers are printed.\\n\"Mirror Group has outperformed other newspaper companies in absorbing a 35 percent increase in newsprint costs, maintaining high levels of marketing investment in the brands and still producing an increase in profits,\" chief executive David Montgomery said.\\n\"The quality of these results confirms Mirror Group as an efficiently run media business now capable of further expansion by deploying its core skills,\" he added.\\nExceptional credits of 12.9 million pounds were realised, principally from the settlement of property related issues.\\nInterim dividend was increased to 1.35p from 1.2p.\\nMarket reaction was positive, Mirror shares adding 5.5p to 207p by 1210 GMT after earlier hitting 210p.\\nMirror Group\\'s flagship title is the tabloid Daily Mirror, Britain\\'s second-top selling newspaper. It also has a major stake in The Independent broadsheet and has recently branched out into cable television.\\nFinance Director John Allwood said that cover price rises had helped to boost circulation revenue by 11 million pounds while advertising revenue was up by around five million.\\nThe group forecast that the price per tonne of newsprint should decline to 475 pounds in the second half of the year from 520 pounds in the first six months.\\nIt said its annual newsprint bill could climb as high as 131 million pounds in 1996, an increase of 20 million pounds, and noted that the pricing trend remained uncertain. The Mirror\\'s Television arm had losses of 4.2 million pounds, stemming from start-up costs at its Live TV local cable service.\\nLive TV\\'s offbeat style, including programmes such as topless darts, has earned it hefty criticism but the company said it was an under-valued asset.\\nIt said that a recent independent assessment had valued the company at up to 90 million pounds and added there were no plans to dispose of it.\\nLive TV is connected to 1.45 million households -- 94 percent of all UK cable homes. It has special local affiliates in central London and Birmingham with plans to add the cities of Liverpool and Edinburgh by the end of the year. ($1=.6430 Pound)\\n']\n",

This will become history.\"\\nRelatives said last week they had found a lawyer willing to defend Wang after being given one day to find one.\\nThe lawyer retained by the family would defend the dissident against other charges in the indictment.\\nWang Dan, former leader of the 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations, has been charged with the capital offence of plotting to subvert the government, based on evidence such as writings critical of the state and accepting funds from abroad.\\nHe was detained by police in a raid on his home in May 1995, but was not formally arrested or charged until last week.\\nOn Friday, the family obtained a copy of the bill of indictment, which accused Wang Dan of plotting to subvert the government, a crime that carries a maximum penalty of death. The minimum sentence is 10 years, although the court can show leniency if it finds extenuating circumstances.\\nWang has already served four years in prison for counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, for his role in the 1989 demonstrations centred in Beijing\\'s Tiananmen Square, which were crushed by the army with heavy loss of life.\\nWang had been expected to face new charges since last December, when the court that convicted veteran democracy activist Wei Jingsheng of plotting to overthrow the government also implicated the former student leader.\\nThe court\\'s verdict said Wei, who was jailed for 14 years, had links with people \"convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, including Wang Dan\". It also referred to a tape-recorded conversation between Wang and Wei, but gave no details.\\nWang had been active since his release from jail, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to join in a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of all those still in prison for their part in the 1989 protests.', 'HM .. i am hehehe', 'HM .. i am hehehe', 'HM .. i am hehehe']\n",
